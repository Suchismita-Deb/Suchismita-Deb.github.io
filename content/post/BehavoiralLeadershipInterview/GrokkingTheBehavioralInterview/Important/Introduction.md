Everyone is an interviewer. **Use good manners!** Being polite is consistent with being polished and professional.

When someone asks, How are you?, reply with good eye contact, a smile, and a positive statement.

### Everyone you interact is an interviewer.

Everyone you encounter, by phone or in-person, could be evaluating you as a candidate. When a decision is being made,
you never know which interaction will tip the scales; anyone from recruiters to parking attendants could impact whether
or not you’re hired.

### Be kind to everyone.

Purpose of the Behavoiral Interview.
**Past behavior is a predictor of future behavior.**
They want to know about you. They might prioritize self-awareness, growth mindset, ambition, humility, comfort with
ambiguity, or risk tolerance.

Whether you will be pioneering a new role or backfilling an existing one, the interviewer knows more about the job than
you do. They also know more about the existing team and organization. Therefore, they may be listening for certain
capabilities and behaviors that will be more likely to make a new hire successful.

### Preparing Doing Homework.

Research about the organization and job description.

Research the organization, study the values that the organization rests their laurels on, and practice how you’re going
to respond.

Research the organization - While researching, look for information on the industry, competitors, market share, products
and services, and brand.

Information like the organization’s mission statement, history, products, services, management, and culture will all be
present on their website. Make sure that you pay special attention to the tone of what is present on the website as well
as the word choice; it will give you a good idea of how the organization communicates and how productive you would be in
such a setting.

Reviewing the News.

The more you know about an organization, the better you will be able to tailor your responses to them. When you are up
to date on organization activity, you will stand out as an invested potential employee.

Research beforehand, every little bit will help your responses to be applicable. It will also help you as you begin to
plan which experiences and past successes or failures you want to highlight at the time of the interview.

Think about the situations like.

Product announcements.
Changes in senior leadership.
Shifts from private to public.
Research breakthroughs.

Review the job posting - Does the role require you to be self-directed and work autonomously? Does the role require
teamwork? Is it a leadership position? Interviewer might not be introduced with the job posting. Side thing always give
relevant experience and put yourself as someone who learns new things, work hard and learns from mistakes.

### List Organization Values.

### Question to ask to understand the organization values.

**Is this an old industry or new industry?**

**What is the size of the industry with respect to the national or global economy?**
