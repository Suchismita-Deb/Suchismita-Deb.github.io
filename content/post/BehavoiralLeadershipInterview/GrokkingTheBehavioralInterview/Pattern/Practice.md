**First the 3 patterns and sample question and sample answers and the questions to ask after the interview.**
### Recognize the behavioral questions.
Question generally starts with
> Tell me about a time when… 
> 
> Can you share a situation when… 
> 
> What do you do when… 
> 
> Give me an example of… 
> 
> Describe a…

Interviewer can ask some question like biggest, greatest, “proudest”, “worst”, “best”, “biggest”, “most significant”, “fastest” situations. 
- One can get confused about the answer as you may think is not the biggest one. In this case listen to the question and come up with the practiced and prepared answers.

In case if it is not the important one then you can say like *“this failure was’t the biggest in terms of loss of business, but it had a significant impact on me because it revealed a blind spot.”*

Interviewer can go for a small talk and ask for some question to make you comfortable or get you off script.

Be prepared for some questions like -
> What do you like to do in your free time?
>
> What book are you reading right now?
> 
> Seen any good movies lately?
> 
> Are you a sports fan?
> 
> Do you have any exciting trips planned?

### Three basic variety of the behavioral questions.
**Prior experience Questions.**

**Hypotheticals.**

**Value Based Questions.**

### Prior Experience Questions.

Interviewers are listening to understand your **instincts and influences**. Interviewer wants to understand you and how you behave in past and they can understand on how will you behave in future.

Even if you are an experienced professional, you may choose an example from a volunteer experience or your personal life that demonstrates who you are.

Make sure that everything you say in a response is **relevant to the response**. Everything that you mention should come back around, if it doesn’t, then it should not be included. For example, think of a recipe in a cookbook. The “ingredient” section only lists things that will be used to make the dish - nothing more, nothing less. Do the same for your answers.

### Example of prior experience questions and answers.

### Tell me about a time when you experienced failure.

" I learned how important it is to take responsibility for a failure as the leader of a team. By taking responsibility, acknowledging the problems, and committing to solutions, I was able to keep the support of the plant leadership. I also remembered that a few of the team members had asked me before the launch about doing more hardware testing and I had dismissed their concerns. I apologized to them and promised to do better going forward. My personal takeaway was to be a better listener and give full consideration to concerns that are brought to my attention."

Use I and not We. Highlight your contribution.

No need to go dep to the jargons. Give overview and emphasise on the learning part and outcome part.

### Sample Questions.

What was the last project you led, and what was its outcome?

Give me an example of a time that you felt you went above and beyond at work.

Describe a time when your work was criticized, how you responded, and what happened as a result.

Have you ever been on a team where someone was not doing their part? How did you handle it?

Tell me about a time when you had to give someone difficult feedback. How did you handle it?

How do you handle working with people who annoy you?

What was the most difficult period in your life, and how did you deal with it?

Give me an example of a time you did something wrong. How did you handle it?

Tell me about a time when you had to deal with conflict on the job.

What assignment was too difficult for you, and how did you resolve the issue?

Give me an example of a difficult decision you had to make. How did you come to that decision?

Give an example of an idea you implemented.

Describe a mentor who has impacted you in a positive way.

Was there a person in your career who really made a difference? In what way?

Tell me about your proudest achievement.

### Example of Prior Experience Questions and Answers.

### When things go wrong, how do you deal with it? Give me an example of a situation you dealt with in a previous role.

I was working as an App Developer for XYZ Company when a Zero-Day Privilege Elevation vulnerability was discovered. Microsoft issued a patch and we had 6000 Windows servers running in 4 different data centers that all needed to be patched as quickly and efficiently as possible (Situation). It wasn’t my job to patch servers, but the VP asked all of us for ideas to get the work done faster (Tasks). I suggested that several of us could help do validation if the procedure was documented. Others could help with tracking the servers coming in and out of rotation and updating tickets. This freed up the Systems Engineers to do the work that only they could do (Actions). I had never done some of those tasks before, so I had to follow procedures exactly and ask for help if I wasn’t sure about something. I was willing to take directions and learn. I took good notes and helped make the documentation easier to follow (Results). I gained a new appreciation for the Systems and Security Engineers. We worked long hours, but it felt good to pull together. It was also good to know that we could do that again if a serious security issue came up.

Be ready for possible follow up questions:

How did you manage separation of duties?
How long did it take overall?

### Hypothetical Questions.

It demonstrates creativity and confidence.

### Parsing and spotting hypothetical questions.

> “Imagine…”
> 
> “If…”
> 
> “Put yourself in the position of…”
> 
> “If you could have…”
> 
> “It’s 2050 and…”
> 
> “You’re in charge of x,y,z and…”

If you are realistic then you will ask for specifics. Resist the urge. If you need specifics then make your assumptions as your specifics.

### Example of Hypothetical Questions.

### If I were your supervisor and asked you to do something that you disagreed with, what would you do?

"If my supervisor asked me to do something I disagreed with I would respectfully push back. I would ask questions about the value of the project/feature/task (etc.) and how it would benefit the greater good of users. It’s important to me that I believe in what I’m working on and if I disagree with it, I think that it’s important and appropriate to push back against my management for further explanation.”

In hypothetial question add those skills and terms that is useful to the organization. Do the research.

### Within a 5-minute time span, the following people come to you asking for help: A V.P. whom you do not regularly interact with, your manager, and a customer. All three say their need is urgent. How do you prioritize them?

**Motivation**
When I ask this question, I’m less concerned with the candidate’s answer and more focused on their thought process. The HOWs and WHYs are the keys for me. Anecdotally, when I’ve asked this question, the majority of the candidates prioritize in the following order: V.P., manager, then the customer. Candidates rarely dig deeper to find out what the requests are. Instead, they prioritize based on titles alone.

I’m mainly looking for two things in the candidate’s response - **Thought process** and **effective communication.**
**Thought Process**.
Does the candidate ask for more information to make an informed decision on how to prioritize? What if the issue the V.P. is facing is the inability to connect their bluetooth speaker to their laptop so they can listen to music in their office? Is that truly more important than a customer needing help? After hearing the needs, are they able to correctly prioritize based on the information they’ve received?

**Communication.**
Do they show that they are able to communicate with people at different levels? Moreover, are they able to deliver “bad” news to people at different levels? Will they let everyone know how and when they plan to address their needs?

### Sample question.

Your team is giving a presentation in two hours and one member just called in sick. What do you do?

If you had to choose between a work environment that was always in chaos and one in which nothing ever changed, which would you choose?

If you inherited so much money that you never had to work again, how would you spend your time?

If you could create a fictional company to make the world a better place, what would that company do?

Imagine that you are the product manager for a consumer device that just launched, but 20% of the devices are breaking in the first week from normal use. What do you do?

Describe how you would handle a situation if you were required to finish multiple tasks by the end of the day, and there was no conceivable way that you could finish them.

### Target.
Complete the response in 2-3 mins.

Able to find the responsibility and action.

Know the why of choosing those actions.

Check if any of the points added values to the organization.

Share some analytical approach and decisions making process.

These questions may not necessarily follow the STAR technique because the situation is given and there are no tangible results that you can declare. Instead, restate the situation, be creative with your tasks and actions, and the results will be implied.


### Value Based Question.

Values-based questions openly examine whether your values are a good match with the organization’s values.

Do the research with the organizations value.

Terms like Extreme Owner, Customer First, Empathy, Team Player, Impactful decisions.

If organization value like "Act like a owner" then in the answer say like "I owned".

If the organization values "Continuous Improvement" then in the answer we can say “this was a one-time fix for the problem, but in order to continuously improve, we monitored the results daily to understand early indicators.”

### Give me an example of an org culture where you felt like you could do your best work. What was it about the culture that allowed you to perform well?

When I was at ABC Foundation, there was a real focus on sharing information. We worked in teams of 8-10 people, each with a Lead. Leads reported up to managers that had two or three teams. The culture was very collaborative. Everybody worked on everything, so you got to know each other’s code and areas of expertise. If you discovered a new problem or way to do something, you were expected to add it to the KB. There was less reliance on tribal knowledge than there is at other places I’ve worked. There was no pressure to act like you know everything. If you had a question, you owned the question until it was answered, and then you were responsible for documenting the answer so others would have it. It wasn’t ok to just pose a question and be stuck if nobody responded. I got better at writing code other people could follow. My documentation really improved. We debated things and tested new ideas, but it wasn’t about something being right or winning an argument. It was about finding the best way to do something, which is really satisfying to me. If I were to join your company, I would hope to foster the same behaviors.

### Test 
Choose the most thorough answer for the question.

### Describe a mentor who has impacted you in a positive way.

Answer 1 - My advisor in college was very supportive of me. She placed me in positions where I would succeed. Even when I didn’t know it, my advisor was always looking for ways that she could help me build my resume. Whenever my advisor sent an opportunity my way, I would take it and try to make the best out of it. Since I knew that her career had been very similar to what I wanted to go into, I fully trusted her and the opportunities that she brought to the table. With the help of my advisor’s recommendations, I was able to secure a good job right out of college. Even though I had only just graduated, I left college with a full resume that made me marketable and brought me to a great, full-time position.

This answer follows the STAR principle.

Answer 2 - Whenever my advisor sent an opportunity my way, I would try it and try to make the best out of it. Since I knew that her career had been very similar to what I wanted to go into, I fully trusted her and the opportunities that she brought to the table. With the help of my advisor’s recommendations I was able to secure a good job right out of college. I graduated with an English degree and was able to build my resume up in a way that made me marketable.

This does not follow the STAR principle and did not covers the result and situation.

### Which of the following questions would be best to ask your interviewer?

**How has this organization changed since you joined?**
This is a good question because its open-ended yet personal to the interviewer. You are likely to hear information that you cannot find on the website.

**What is a typical day at your organization?**
The answer to this question could be easily deduced by looking at the company website. Things like company culture and the type of company could lead you to figuring out this answer by yourself.

**What is your organization’s culture?**
This is a tricky one because it seems like it would be a good question to ask, but it’s not. If you would like to ask about company culture make it more specific. The interviewer should be able to see where you’re coming from when you ask a question.
