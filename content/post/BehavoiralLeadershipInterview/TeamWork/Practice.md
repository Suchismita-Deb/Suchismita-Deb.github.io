### Practice Team Work Related Behavioral Question.

### Tell me about a time when you had to escalate a person in your team/organization?

Always start with the premise that the other person has good intention, and once you recognize that the person is no way to change his opinion and you believe you are in the right side of the situation, you would need to go and have a mediator, someone that could advocate towards what the company/standard is and be unbias towards the situation.

You may have some example to illustrate that, such as, "Once we had a person in the team that refused to have his code reviewed before promoting into production, even though it never resulted in a production issue, it was against our code development standards and after several attempts to work it out directly with that person, I have no other option but escalate for help... bla, bla..."

### Answer any question in the round like "Experience + Learn = Grow" format or STAR technique

### How do you handle a heavy workload?

One type of Answer - We all have times when the workload gets a little heavier than normal. I've found that the best way to handle it is to step back, take a look at everything on my task list, and prioritize. Most of the time, not everything needs to get done immediately. Some things are more critical to team goals than others, so sometimes it's necessary to prioritize."

Then, tell a short story about a time when you did that, and tell what the results of it were: you got X task done, which was beneficial because of Y.


Another way - In that kind of situation, prioritizing and teamwork both become critical. I speak to my supervisor to see if I can help him or her and get some input on which tasks to tackle first."

Then, talk about the time you assisted your boss on a mission-critical task and what happened as a result of that teamwork.

### Every interview question should be able to sell you the job.

How do you rate yourself. In case if donot know the answer then say it and then give some idea.

"On a scale of 1 to 10, a 5 would be a true average, and a 10 is perfect. I think I’m better than average, and no one is perfect."
