### Communication Skills.

### How do you handle a disagreement with your coworkers? Give me an example of a time when you successfully persuaded someone to see things your way.

Situation - In a project I was working on the module in the application. I noticed an issue in the proposed design for a specific section which will create issue when more number of file needed.
They were generating specific file for the reports and that needed deparate tool to make the template and later we will integrate it with the backend.
Mainly the itext separate tool and template and another one is for the changing in the backend itself. Describe the situation clearly so that the interviewer will understand the importance.

Task - As a specific todo item I felt the necessity to connect with my lead once and discussed with the issue I was anticipating to analysis it beforehand so that it doest not cause any project delay and extra work.

Action - To address in a proper structures manner I gathered the proof and data of the scenario and conducted a thorough analysis of the architecture. Instread of confronting directly in the developer connect call I made a one on one meeting and disussed my findings properly. First I discussed as how I have understood the design and I then show the scenarios where it may cause issues in the performance and maintainance.

Result: After reviewing my analysis and the proposed plan, my team lead saw the potential benefits of revising the architecture. He appreciated the effort I put into backing up my argument with data and a clear implementation strategy. Consequently, we adjusted the architecture, and the project proceeded smoothly. The revised design indeed proved to be more scalable, and the application handled the growing user base effectively without any major issues. This experience reinforced the importance of combining clear communication, evidence-based arguments, and empathy when resolving disagreements at work.

### What would you do if you misunderstood an important task on the job? Give me an example.

Yes I had one such scenarios. So I started working in that team recently and I was assigned with one development story where I have to call api and remove dependencies on other microservice and use the endpoint. It is 2 week spring and in the sprint starting I was assigned this task and I was given 1 week of time. I was not having any issue. However we had some miscommunication with the deadline. I thought that it would be the date to have the design planning discussion and the development. Then after that we will test for the other scenarios and do the coverage and validate. Apparently what they meant was to have the entire end to end development done within one week.

Task - I submitted my work one dy before and discussed wit the design and the development and then made the changes the manager suggested and completed that. All within 3-4 days.

Action - Later on another day I spend the entire day validating the issue and testiong for other scenarios and completeing code coerage. We completed the story on that day and make sure it was spotless.

Result - My lead appreciated the effort and for me now I became more specific about the requeirements and try to communicate in understanding the goals they are expecting.

### How do you handle criticism from coworkers or supervisors?

Situations - In the release time UAT there were more numbers of defect assigned to the developers. More were assigned and my manager connected stating that teh defects are not going with time and they are spill over to the next sprint.

Task - Timing was crutial. I connected wit my lead and it was indeed some critical defect as some other team was also involved.

Action - Decide dto make extra meeting with the coworker and shout advice form other develpoer who knew more detailed of the project. I put more time for the analysis and closed the defects for that sprint.

Result - My effort paid off and all the story was closed and the defect were resolved. We enhanced the decision from te next spring and had a good bonding with the lead. My manager complimented that how quickly I took his feedback and ended up ultimately contributing to more streamlined process.

### Tell me about a time you disagreed with a performance assessment you received. How did you handle it?

Situation - Example of giviing rating like 4.3. 
Task - I knew I had to clear this up. It is important dor the career progressiona nd also I neede dto feel valued and appreiated. Also I woul like to knwo anywhere I need to improve and 
Action - Reuqested a follow up meeting and my supervisor and discussed and also placed all the scenarios nd work that I did nd got positive feedback I recieved from diffwerent teams. I shared everything suring the meeting and highlighr ,y contribution over the past year.
Result - 

### Have you ever had to work under someone who wasn’t very good at communicating? What happened?

Situation - Can turn by saying someone worked with me who is not into clear communication. Was facing issue in collaborating with her.
Task - Understand her point of view.
Action -Made more one on one meeting and discussed the issue. Turns out she was overwhelmed with the work and not able to understand more about the project. She joined a s replacement of another person and now no ne is there to giove the Kt to her.
Result - Shared the review with the lead and she mention to give some kt to her and proceeded accordingly. I used to give her some ionputs on where she feels issua and by time she abvle to grasp the project.

### Tell me about a time when you successfully explained a technical problem to a coworker or a customer who didn’t have a tech background.

Situtaion - Itext limitation.
Task - Need to make the scrum master understand about the issue as the contract of the task was coming from his side.
Action - One on one meeting with him and showed the cases on where it will work and where it will not.
Result - He undrstoof the issue and my lead also suggested to have a one on one meeting with the businees and changed some portion in teh requirement and then it was doable with the software.

### What do you think about one-on-one meetings? How often do you think they should happen?

Situation - Previos project we did not hve much of teh one on one and later I realised that I was notable to undetsand the performance growth and the improvement. 
Task - In the next project I trie dto be nore consisytent with teh one on one communicaytion to help myself and the tenam to be oon track.

Action - I generalkly hve my one- ion one with me lkead and generally once in a week we have the csheueld meeting. She only approves my or and gives teh review in general nd there only I got to if I am getting more review comments or not apart from that I connect with her and complete the discussion to get the feedback.

Result - I noticed many chabnegs and realused how imporatnt it is for me as now exactly I know at what pace I am lerning and if get tuck I call out immediately and now actually liking it as everty week Iam getting my performance that helps me to stay on track.

### Can you tell me about a time you gave a presentation that was particularly successful? Why do you think it went well?

Situation - In the first project I got quite a few opportunity to speak in font of teh business and presented my work. business demo for the changed requirement.
Task - Give the deo with in one week of teh requirement change. 
Action - had to complete my development and validate for all the scenarios and started working for all teh cases. Gave the presentation and the lead was really have as they know that this is the changes done within a week.
Result - Got good feedback and the lead said that the business was happy and satisfied with the changes and the meeting was successful.

### Tell me about a time when you had to rely on written communication to get your ideas across.

Situation - Project work dependent on other team and had to communicate with them only though emails as it wasnot critical for them but for our project it was important as it has some dependencies. I could not able to get connected with the concerned person.
Tak - Need to connumicate all deatils via mail. I can readily do that ut I was feeling like one meeting will work more in this case.
Action - Aded all te information and also I did th eanalysis on his behalf as clearly just communicating will not work and he will notget the time to complete it. I gave some suggestion and analysis and that should get the owrk done.
Result - he did his validaion and chose one of my feedbacka nd the task was done. Took a bit time but at the end of teh day itwas doen.
