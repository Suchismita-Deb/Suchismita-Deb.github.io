### Why Company?

Answer structure.

Research - Article line, quote in the answer.

Purpose - Show the passion and purpose has more importance. 

Job description - skill alignment.

Talk about the company product.

Structure - One minute or less, Rule of Three focus on specific three items, no praising of google and no praising of yourself, Set up, be warm and kind.


Sample - I would say from the user perspective. Every one uses google product everyday search, youtube, meeting. More importantly the culture is what I am relly fascinated about like the positivity, inclusivity and really fond of the opportunity to learn and grow in any position at the organization. My passion and excitement to the product and the way it serves millions of people in a most efficient way. I am happy to work in any of the product and all of them get me exited  join google and my input.



**Take the interview in your hand.**
### Tell me about yourself.
Sample - My core principle stays in these areas. Based on the requirements, news and job descriptions add those points and say like I think my core skills really align with the role.
But as you think about the role today the company needs and if we are talking about core skills A, B and C is that the one you prefer me to  focus on than another as I want to make sure hat I am giving you the insight into me that helps you to figure out if I am the right person for the role.

Think in this space with the role, core skills and the purpose.
