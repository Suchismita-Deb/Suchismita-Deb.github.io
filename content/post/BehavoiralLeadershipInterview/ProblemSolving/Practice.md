### Do you have any work habits you’d like to improve?

**Situation** - I am a blog writer mainly I target to learn something and put it in blogs to revise or make it concise or add additional detail. I have a bit of a habit of pushing my work until the last minute. It's something I've managed to get away with because I always meet my deadlines, but it definitely turns into a crunch.

**Task** - I realised it is not the good way to be consistent and I need to make it smooth.

**Action** - I made some plans. As it is personal work so it gets delayed with any change in plan. I made a routine that I will learn something new by every week and be consistent in modifying and writing.

**Result** - Its been working out pretty well and I am consistent in the learning. I can see the benefits.

What have you done to make your work more productive in your previous roles?

Situation: "When I was working as an administrative assistant at a law firm, I noticed that a lot of my time was spent just looking for things. Whether it was a misplaced file on my desk or a lost email in my inbox, it was slowing me down."

Task: "I decided to tackle this problem head-on to make my days more productive and keep everything running smoothly."

Action: "First, I reorganized my desk. I set up a system where the most frequently used items were right at my fingertips. For my digital files, I meticulously organized my bookmarks and online folders, labeling everything clearly and setting up shortcuts for the files I accessed daily."

Results: "These changes really streamlined my workflow. I spent less time digging through drawers or clicking through folders, which gave me more time to focus on the real work. My coworkers and bosses noticed the improvement too, which definitely felt good. It just goes to show that sometimes it's the little things that can make the biggest difference in how productive you are."
