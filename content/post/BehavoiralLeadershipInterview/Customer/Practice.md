### Show me a time when you demonstrated customer empathy in your role? How did you become aware of what the customer needed? How did you know the end result? What was the most challenging thing about delivering the solution. How did you overcome resistance.

Technical Program Manager. This is the time when I was a technical program manager at the techSolution XYZ. I was tasked with a particularly challenging project for the largest enterprise client, Bank Corp. Teh bank was facing significant issue i the financial analysis software which was not integrated smoothly wth the legacy system leading to some data discrepancies and operation delays. The project not only involved the technical enhancement but also involved collaboration with the client it and operations team to ensure the solution meets their specific needs. My responsibility was to redesign and optimize the integration of our software with the client system. The project timeline was set to 3 months and in that time we need to design and develop and test and deploy the changes.
The first action I took is like a deep dive in the existing issues and research by analysing application logs and system error reports.
Had detailed discussion with the other staff who had good knowledge of the legacy system. I got a comprehensive understanding of the technical landscape and the specific requirements.

Next the planning phase involved developing a customized solution trailored to the bank infrastructure. Organized and set up meetings with the specialist and consultants and the Subject Matter Experts to finalize the design of the robust integration architecture.

We used advanced project management tools, created a phased out roll out plan that would allow for gradual implementation without risking the banks core operations.

In the initial conversation wit the stakeholder we need to get aligned with the expectations and resources so I scheduled meeting with senior executives and the client management to establish clear communication channel and agreed on the project milestones and deliverables.

Then we entered in the testing phase well that was rigoruos and the development has like tons of different functionality and we needed to see all the cases and understand all are working fine. We simulate real world scenarios. We have also dne like stress testing and load testing to ensure stability and performance before going online. We also had one onsite person with us while testing to ensure that the solution met their expectations to get their feedback directly.

We follow like agile and devops practices to ensure timely deliveries, daily standups, weekly check with the clients, monitor the logs and progress, identify the issues early and adjust plans.

We also had rigorous integration and continuous deployment practices to streamline updates and reduce the downtime.

The launch of the product was staged accordingly to the critical needs of the banks operational areas. We first applied less critical deployment ad gather feedback and then go with the full scale roll out.
This cautious approach allows us to perform full scale roll out and then we are prepared with detailed documentations and training materials facilitates a smooth transition for the users.

Then we presented the final results involving the detailed analysis and reporting. I compiled the new end points and the collections, the performance metrics demonstrating the system efficiencies and accuracies. I presented these findings durig the formal meetings with the client which included pre and post integration comparisons .

The documentations and the ongoing optimizations are the final steps. We established a details operational manuals and the functionalities for the client and set up support line for any issues in the post deployment.

A quarterly release based review process is also conducted to monitor the system performance and discuss potential upgrade or improvements.

The results - Out project involved in 30% increased in the easyness of teh additional functionality and 20 % reduction in the downtime directly addressing the user empathy and solving a significant point for the client.

The client are satisfied with the system noting the responsiveness and adaptability of the team. The project not only reinforced the relationship between our key clients but also provided a scalable and repeatable model for future improvement, enhancing out reputation as a customer centric team capable of handling complex enterprise challenges.

Google GCA. Target interviewer should be able to picture you in the role then you are likely getting hired.


### Working with Client and Customer.

Sometimes, clients can be difficult to work with. Can you describe a situation when a client was wrong and you had to correct them? Describe a time you dealt with a frustrating customer or stakeholder. Everyone makes mistakes they regret. Is there a situation where you wish you had handled things with a client differently?

Describe a time when it was especially important to make a good impression on a client. How did you go about doing so?
Give me an example of a time when you didn’t meet a client’s expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?
Tell me about a time when you made sure a customer was pleased with your service.
Describe a time when you had to interact with a difficult client or customer. What was the situation, and how did you handle it?
