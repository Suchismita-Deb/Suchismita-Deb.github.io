**Ask Clarifying Question**  
Hello before diving in, I would like to ask some clarifying questions, I would be curious are we focussing on a physical office space, data storage space or both?   
I would also be curious are we focussing just on USA global location. Are there any major project plans between now and in the time range I should be considering just a yes or no.

Should I be considering any potential acquisition or merger or should I leave those out. Is there an specific growth rate target that is already been set by the leadership like 5%, 10% or more.

Few points that I would like to know like the historical data, current usage and growth projection.
Any external factors then I will be focussing on the resource allocation, budget constraint and risk factors.

Based on the answer and assume the value and gave the idea.
