### Google cloud data flow and cloud functions.
Google cloud dataflow and the Apache Beam are the same open source Technologies with Google Cloud data flow is the managed version of the Apache Beam in the Google cloud platform.

### Google Cloud DataFlow.
What is Apache Beam? What are PCollections and PTransforms in Apache Beam?

Apache beam is an open-source platform it's a unified model for both batch and stream processing pipelines and it it allows you to build complex uh data and processing workflows that are like portable across all different types of execution engines known as Runners.
PCollections is mainly a data abstraction layer in beam which represents a distributed immutable and possibly a bounded or an unbounded data set.
PTransforms are the operation that you perform on this P collection so they can be ParDo, GroupBy, Combine all these other types of Transformations.


### How does Beam handle windowing?

beam handles windwing by its window strategies like fixed windows sliding Windows session windows and Global windows

### What are the different runners available in Apache Beam?
the Google data flow Runner the Flink Runner the spark Runner the direct runner for your local execution and finally the samza runner
### How does Apache Beam handle data shuffling?
beam handles data shuffling by using the part do and the group by transforms.
the data that is shuffled between the workers and it ensures that the same data with the same key are sent to to the same workers for processing.

### What is the role of SideInputs and SideOutputs in Apache Beam?
SideInputs are a small additional data set that can be used in that same P transform in additional uh to the main P collection that you are using so this is basically used when you need to filter on a particular data set based on a certain predefined condition or a lookup value.
SideOutputs - side outputs is a specialized paru transform when you need to Output multiple P collections from a single input and what are the use case for it suppose you want to use uh two different P collections one for valid records and other for invalid records so you can do that using the side outputs.

### Whar is a combiner in Apache Beam?
combiners are a specialized P transform used for aggregation and you can mention the two types of combiners that are present the predefined combiners which includes the sum mean Max count and the custom combiners which you can do by extending the combine F class.
### Difference between Map and FlatMap?
map applies a function and returns a new collection so add the source element and the destination elements are one to one mapped and what is a flat map so a flat Maps applies a similar type of function but the source elements and the destination elements may not be one to one map so there might be one to many map or one to zero map.
### Explain the various transformers in Beam like ParDo, GBK, CPK.

### What are composite Transforms?
composite transforms are similar P transform that are composed of uh like multiple transforms together and what are their use they make your code reusable and modular so they uh like serve the same function as a function in object oriented programming.
### IO sources you have used and how they are used in your project - BQ, PubSub, GCS.

### What is the difference between event time and processing time in Apache Beam.
event time is the time where the data event actually occurred at source and what is the processing time processing time is the time when the data is processed by the pipeline itself.

### How does the Apache Beam's watermark mechanism work in streaming pipelines?
watermark in beam is an estimate of the system's progress in processing the events so there are two ways uh any time stamp that is uh before the watermark are considered on time while the events which have like a time stamp after the watermark are considered late elements and then the system can decide like whether to handle it using a data handling strategies or like to drop it.
### What are the trade-offs between different windowing and triggering strategies in stream processing?
there are fixed windows which are simple and predictable but may not be hand able to handle irregular events with irregular frequencies then you have the sliding Windows which can capture overlapping windows and which are useful for like smoother rolling aggregations but they have have increased level of complexity then you have the session Windows which are used for capturing periods of user activity but are harder to predict and configure.
triggers control when the results are emitted so you can have the early triggers which can provide like a fast feedback but the results might be incomplete and finally you have the late triggers which can handle late data but the increase the overall system complexity.
### How does Beam handle large datasets and sharding in batch processing?
large data set beam automatically shards the large data into smaller pieces and then Distributing them across all its workers.
### What are global windows, and in what scenarios would they be useful in Apache Beam?
a global window treats everything like all the data as a part of a one single window which means there is no time best grouping basically the time Dimension itself is missing this is very helpful when you are Computing results over a long period of time.
### What is a Splittable DoFn, and how is it different from a standard DoFn?
splitable do function allows like long running operations to be split into it multiple smaller parts that can be processed in parallel or can be resumed if they are interrupted.
### How do you handle backpresure in an Apache Beam streaming pipeline?
It occurs when like the system is overwhelmed by too much data so there are less resources and there is too much data to process. Beam handle the back pressure by delegating this task to its underlying Runner like Flink Runner or a spark Runner which manages this data buffering and throttling and it can also scale these resources based on the needs.
### What are merge Accumulators?
merge accumulators are used as a part of the combiner pattern so when a data needs to be either like uh combined or aggregated especially when it comes to distributed system the combiner first processes the data across multiple workers producing like the partial results called the accumulators then these accumulators are merged to produce a final aggregated results so there are two types of aggregation that are happening first you have the local sum that happens in each worker and then there is a global sum where like the data from all these local workers are merged globally.
### Explain the various lifecycle methods.
setup the start bunding the process element the Finish bundle and the tear down options.
### What are type hints and Data Encoding?
type hints type hints in beam are a like a way to specify the expected type of data elements that are being processed by the pipeline so when you add this type of type hints to a transform it ensures like there is a type safety and you can catch the errors earlier in the pipeline uh and not at the uh like the at the later stage of the final stages of the pipeline.
data encoding refers like how the data is serialized and deserialized when there is a transfer of data between different components of a pipeline and how does beam ensured this data encoding it ensures it by using the orders.
### What are Acumulation Modes in Apache Beam?
the two accumulation modes the discarding one and the accumulating mode.
### What are State and Timers in Beam?
states allow you to store information about each element or key during the stream processing.
timers basically allow you to specific times to trigger an action like handling of late data or emitting results at any future point in time.
### What is Serialization and Deserialization in Apache Beam?
serialization is like a process of converting objects into a format that can be sent across a network or saved to a disk so like turn it's basically turning objects into its bytes.
converting the formatted data back to its object so that it can be used during processing.

it's used in all distributed systems where the data needs to be transferred across like different machines or worker nodes.
### How do you share a variable across all workers in Apache Beam?
side inputs allow you to share data across all worker like configuration data lookup tables or any shared values that are constant throughout your pipeline
### How do you do error handling in Beam?
error handling in beam like normal pythonic way like using the tricast blocks or you can use the side outputs.
### Features available in Java SDK not available in Python SDK.
stream processing there are states and timers which are not available like not properly available in Python SDK then you have this splitable do function which are used for large scale handling it now right now we have limited support but full functionality is not available then there are some Advanced IO connectors also which are not available in uh python SDK but they are uh available in the standard Java SDK
### How does Apache Beam implement distributed checkpointing for exactly-once semantics in streaming pipelines?
beam relies on the runner to handle a checkpointing so if you are using Google Cloud then you will be using the Google cloud data flow Runner to uh like process the data only once so this checkpointing saves the progress of the data processing at like every specific interval so if a failure happens the pipeline will be resumed from its last checkpoint.

### How does Beam achieve cross-platform portability.
it achieves through what we call Runners that we previously discussed so the distributor system like data flow fling spark so these are the runners that uh what you say handle the crossplatform portability so you can like write the pipeline only once in your uh preferred language like whether it's Java or python you can use any SDK of your choice and then the beam translates this logic to a compatible which is ever like Runner you plan to choose.

### Cloud Function.

### How do you trigger a Google Cloud Function?
there are various ways to trigger a cloud function you can do it either via HTTP request via pub sub messages via Google Cloud Storage events which are connected to event AR or you can trigger it from other Google cloud services like fire store analytics or any other custom Services which are integrated with the event Arc.
### What is the maximum execution time for a Google Cloud Function?
Gen uh gen One Cloud functions the maximum execution time limit is like 9 minutes and for the gen2 which is the newer one for https uh Cloud functions it supports up to 60 minutes.
### What languages are supported by Google Cloud Functions?
python go Java net Ruby nodejs.
### What is the difference between Cloud Functions and Cloud Run?
cloud function is designed for like small Event Event task where uh like it needs to automatically scale in response to events but when it comes to Cloud run it's specifically for like containerized application and it's more suited where you need to uh deploy web applications or apis or any other long running processes where you need some level of control over the environment.
### What is the purpose of environment variables in Google Cloud Functions?
environment variables allows you to conf configure your data Secrets or any other settings that uh that is basically outside your code so this can uh include your API Keys your database credentials or any other settings that can change between environments like from development to testing or production so this environment variables ensures that the sensitive like sensitive data is not encoded directly into your Cloud function source code itself and how does it help us so it makes your code much more secure and easier to manage.
### Advantages of Cloud Function Gen2 over Gen1.
Gen 2 has longer execution time like 60 Minutes versus 9 minutes for Gen one then it has it's highly scalable it has more resource option it can respond to more event sources and also it has greater Regional availability.

### How do you implement error handling in Cloud Functions in context of data processing pipelines.
the easiest way is to use the TR cat block so you can use that normal pythonic way of using a tricast block and ensure all your failures are properly handled for automatic retri triggered via pops sub or HTTP make sure that the number of automatic retries are set to a lower value also ensure that your logs are uploaded to Google Cloud logging for monitoring and alerting purposes.
### How do you ensure idempotency in Google Cloud Functions, particularly when handling data ingestion events?
it by multiple ways first you can use a d duplication strategy like assigning a unique ID to each event next you can do it by quing a cache or a database and checking whether the event has already been processed previously you can also store the event state in a persistent storage system and skip the current processing if the event has already been handled previously.
### How would you handle schema evolution in a BigQuery table using Google Cloud Functions for real-time data ingestion?
bigquery client library to dynamically modify the table schema in response to the new fields or the new records that you are getting by adding the new columns to the destination table as and when required you can also Implement a schema validation process in our Cloud function that checks like the new data against the current schema that is there and you can update the uh Source schema of the destination schema accordingly.
### How would you implement data deduplication in Google Cloud Functions when ingesting large volumes of streaming data into BigQuery?
can do it via two ways you can Implement Big's Marge statement to perform D duplication while inserting the records or while using pup sub uh you can add the timestamps to the record that ensures that only the unique records are written into the destination table.
### Explain how you can handle backpressure and throttling in a Google Cloud Function consuming high-frequency events from Pub/Sub.
can do it via various ways you can control the concurrency by setting the max instances in the cloud function you can batch your messages together to process multiple events per function invocation then you can use DT or dead letter Q topics for uh fail messages then you can Implement uh retry policies that have an like an exponential back off you can also increase your acknowledgement deadlines to give more times for your message to get processed you can also set up monitoring and alerting for your function performance.
### Describe an approach to managing state across multiple Google Cloud Functions in a real-time data pipeline
Cloud functions are inherently stateless by Nature so managing the state is a bit difficult but not impossible so how do we do it the solution is to choose a state management solution first like either Google Cloud Storage or Cloud file store or Cloud memory store or we can use cloud SQL then we can use pops up to communicate between the different Cloud functions like the first Cloud function will publish uh the message to the topic and the second Cloud function will subscribe to the topic and pull the messages we should also Implement uh state versioning in case of an update to the state using the standard versioning techniques like either time stamps or incremental counters this will basically ensure that we are always operating on the correct version of the function State we can also decide to use Google Cloud workflows if we are using multiple Cloud functions together while maintaining the uh like this state between the steps in the workflow variables itself.
