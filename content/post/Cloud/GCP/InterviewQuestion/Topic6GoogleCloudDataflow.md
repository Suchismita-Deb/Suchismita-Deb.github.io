Bounded P Collections - Correspond to final data sets typically use in batch processing.  
Unbounded PCollections - Correspond to infinal database typically used in stream processing.
P collections are used to apply transformations. pass data between different stages of a pipeline And handle complex data workflows in a parallelized manner.
Describe the different types of transforms available in Google or data flow.
transforms our operations applied to P collections to process data. E types includes
pardo - A parallel do operation that applies a user defined function to each element In the input P collections producing zero or more output elements for input element.
Group by key - group's elements of happy collection by a specified key useful for aggregating data by key.
Co Group By Keys - Merges 2 or more PCollections by their keys, combined data from different sources into a single PCollections.
Combine - aggregates data across AP collection applying a user defined function to reduce the dataset. Examples include summing values or computing averages.
Flatten - Merges multiple PCollections into a single P collections
Partition - divides up the collection into multiple P collections based on a user defined partitioning function.
### Explain the concept of windowing in data flow.

Fixed time Windows divided into non overlapping fixed size intervals. Example, five minutes.

Sliding window.- create overlapping windows that slide over time. Capturing data in overlapping intervals. Example, every one minute sliding window of 5 mins duration.
Session Windows Group events that occur within a specified gap division This was a capturing period of activity followed by inactivity
global windows - all data belongs to a single infinite window typically used when windowing is not required or for batch processing.

### What is Watermark in Data flow?
A watermark is a timestamp indicated the data flow users to track the progress of events dying within a streaming pipeline. It estimates the point is event time up to which all data is expected to have been received. Watermarks help determine when to trigger windowed computations and manage late data.
A Watermark ensures that results are produced timely while balancing the completeness and accuracy of the data processing.
How does Google cloud data still handle late data?Dataflow allows for the handling of late data by specifying an allowed lateness period in windowing.

This is done done through the "with Allowed Lateness" method in Apache Beam. Data flow users triggers to control when results are emitted for each window.

The combination of allowed lateness and triggers allows late arriving data to be included In the competitions of for a window, even after the Watermark has advanced. this approach ensures that the pipeline can handle real world scenarios where data can arrive out of order or be delayed.
### what are triggers in data flow?
Rigors control when the results for a window are produced based on certain conditions. different types of triggers include - event time tribal - based on the probe grass of events time as indicated by the watermark.
Processing time trigger based on the actual time of processing rather than even time

element count tribal  - fires after a specified number of elements have been processed in a window.

Composite triggers combine multiple trigger conditions to create complex triggering scenarios For example, firing on event time and refiring after a certain processing time if additional late data arrives.
Triggers provide flexibility in managing how and when results are output from a pipeline Enabling sophisticated handling of different data arrival patterns and processing requirements.
