## System Design of APIs and Microservices.

Designing APIs and microservices requires careful planning to ensure scalability, reliability, maintainability, and performance. Here's a step-by-step approach to system design for APIs and microservices.

### Requirements.

**Functional Requirement** - Requirement of the API or microservice. Example - User Authentication, Product Management, Order, Catalog, Inventory.  
**NonFunctional Requirement** - Scalability, Availability, Reliability, Latency, and Throughput.  
**Constraints** - Technology stack, response time, cost limits, or existing system constraints.

### Identify Microservice.

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - Each microservice should handle one specific business function.  
Example: Separate microservices for user management, inventory, and order processing.

**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** - Break down the system into bounded contexts and align microservices with these contexts.

**Loosely Coupled Architecture** - Microservices should be independent to avoid cascading failures.

### API Design.
